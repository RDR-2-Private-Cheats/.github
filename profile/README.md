## 🧭 Overview

This private package blends stealthy visualization, predictive targeting, environmental awareness, and system optimization into a configurable toolkit. Designed for players who demand both subtlety and power, every module is customizable—overlays, distance filters, heatmaps, tracking lines, and aim-response curves all shift to match your personal tempo.

No two riders carve the West the same way. This tool honors that.

## 🎯 Features

Every module is carved for precision, subtlety, and absolute configurability:

* **Spectral ESP Layer**
  Highlights wildlife, enemies, valuables, structures, and vehicles—distance-scaled and color-adjustable.

* **Private Aim Engine**
  A refined soft-lock system with customizable FOV cones, adaptive smoothing, mounted-combat profiles, and prediction curves.

* **Loot & Plant Radar**
  Marks herbs, pelts, ammunition, treasure, and crafting materials for efficient gathering routes.

* **Threat Awareness Heatmap**
  Displays escalating danger zones around towns, camps, and ambush points.

* **Profile QuickSwap Hub**
  *Stealth*, *Hunting*, *Sharpshooter*, *Exploration*—or craft your own profiles from scratch.

[!IMPORTANT]
To maintain a natural feel, avoid pairing aggressive aim curves with high FOV assist—they may overcorrect during rapid movement.

## ⚡ Setup & Configuration

Let the toolbox settle into your saddlebag:

1. Download the private cheat build via badges above.
2. Extract into a fresh directory (avoid cloud drives).
3. Launch as administrator to initialize memory & overlay modules.
4. Begin with a modest preset:

   ```ini
   [stealth]
   esp_distance = 220
   aim_smoothing = 0.55
   prediction_curve = linear
   herb_radar = true
   heatmap_intensity = 0.35
   ```
5. Open the live tuner (`F7` by default) to refine brightness, target priorities, and FOV boundaries.

[!NOTE]
Players using ultrawide monitors should increase overlay scale by +15% for crisp silhouettes.
